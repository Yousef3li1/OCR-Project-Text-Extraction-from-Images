# 📝 OCR Project – Text Extraction from Images  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements an **Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system** capable of extracting text from images, including low-quality or scanned documents.  
The pipeline combines **OpenCV preprocessing** with **Tesseract OCR** and optional deep learning enhancements for improved accuracy.  
It also supports **multilingual text recognition** (Arabic & English).  

## 🚀 Features  
- Preprocessing pipeline: grayscale, noise filtering, edge detection, and binarization.  
- Text extraction from scanned/low-quality images.  
- Support for **Arabic and English text**.  
- Extendable for real-time OCR applications.  
- Notebook-based implementation for easy experimentation.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The project can work with:  
- Custom images (JPG/PNG) provided by the user.  
- Public datasets for OCR tasks (optional).  

## ⚙️ Installation  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/ocr-project.git
